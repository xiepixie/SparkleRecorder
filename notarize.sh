# Notarize and staple the installed TinyRecorder.app so other people can run it
# without Gatekeeper warnings. Requires:
#   1. A Developer ID-signed build (run ./build.sh with a Developer ID cert).
#   2. Notary credentials stored ONCE in the keychain (no secrets live in this
#      file). Create an app-specific password at https://appleid.apple.com →
#      Sign-In & Security → App-Specific Passwords, then run:
#
#        xcrun notarytool store-credentials tinyrecorder-notary \
#          --apple-id "you@example.com" \
#          --team-id  "YOURTEAMID" \
#          --password "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
#
# After that, just run: ./notarize.sh
